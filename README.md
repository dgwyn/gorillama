## Convential Commits

This is a example of a Convential Commit. Convential Commits are linked with SemVer, by having fixes, features, and breaking describing changes in the commit.
<type>(scope): description
  [optional body]
  
  [optinal footer(s)]
  
  ### Convential Commit Types
  
  A commit contains the following SemVers, it will state what *type* of change you made.
  
  1. Fix: a commit with the type `fix` patches a bug in your code (in SemVer, a Patch)
  2. Feat: a commit with the type `feat` makes a new feature in your code (in SemVer, a minor change)
  3. BREAKING CHANGE: a commit with the footer `BREAKING CHANGE` or has a `!` after the scope or type, represents a breaking API change (in SemVer, a major change)
